User Guide
==========

This user guide provides instructions for how to use the free open-source Modelica `Buildings <http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica>`_ library.
The user guide covers: 

- How to get started.
- Best practices to create models and run simulations.
- Work-arounds to problems in translating or simulating models.
- Pre- and post-processing.
- Resources for users who want to develop or contribute models to the library.
- information for how to get help.


The following information can be found in the Modelica files rather than in this documentation:

- The physical assumptions and the equations that the models are based on.
- Advice as to which models may be used if multiple models may be available for similar equipment or physical phenomena.
