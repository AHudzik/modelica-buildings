BuildingsPy Changelog
---------------------

Version 1.1.0, xxx, 2012 -- Release 1.1
---------------------------------------
- Added class buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.
  This simplifies the creation of boxplot and the
  plotting of data that repeat every day.
- Moved function buildingspy.development.unittest.Tester.__interpolate
  to buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.interpolate
- Caught exception that is caused when non-ascii characters are
  used in the comments of constants, parameters or variables. Now,
  these files are excluded from the unit tests and a warning is issued.
- Centralized error reporting to using buildings.io.reporter instead
  of writing directly to stderr.
- Fixed error in buildingspy.io.postprocess.Plotter.interpolate().
  The previous version could lead to non-increasing time for
  the last time stamp of the results, and then led to an wrong result
  of the interpolation function.
- Changed file output: The output of Dymola is now in the file dymola.log,
  whereas unitTests.log contains the warning and error messages of the python
  unit test scripts.

Version 1.0.0, November 1, 2011
