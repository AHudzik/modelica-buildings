annotation (Documentation(info="<html>
This package contains an interface to the 
<a href=\"https://gaia.lbl.gov/bcvtb\">Building Controls Virtual Test Bed</a>
(BCVTB).
The BCVTB is a middleware that is based on 
<a href=\"http://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/\">Ptolemy II</a>.
Ptolemy II is a software framework to study modeling, simulation, and design of concurrent, real-time, embedded systems, with focus on the assembly of concurrent components and the use of heterogeneous mixtures of models of computation that govern the interactions between components. The BCVTB adds functionalities to Ptolemy II that allows coupling Modelica, 
<a href=\"http://www.energyplus.gov\">EnergyPlus</a> and
<a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com\">MATLAB/Simulink</a>
for data exchange during the time step integration.
