User Guide
==========

This user guide provides instructions for how to use the free open-source Modelica `Buildings <http://simulationresearch.lbl.gov/modelica>`_ library.
The user guide covers how to get started, it describes best practice for creating models and running simulations, it describes work-arounds to problems in translating or simulating models, it describes pre- and post-processing, it provides ressources for users who want to develop or contribute models to the library and it provides information for how to get help.


Note that the following information can be found in the Modelica files rather than in this documentation:

- The physical assumptions and the equations that the models are based on.
- Advice as to which models may be used if multiple models may be available for similar equipment or physical phenomena.
