  //fixme - Names of constructions are done using same method as elsewhere in Buildings library. Getting crazy long. Find better convention?
  //fixme - Insul(x=0.2032) are SIPs. Thickness of SIPs not specified in drawings. 8" assumed. Change when know real value. Is modeling SIP as insulation board legit? Would think so (SIP = no thermal bridge, insulation board = no thermal bridge)
  //fixme - Construction for UF90X3A ceiling (GypxInsulyPlyz) is not necessarily right. Check thickness of insul tomorrow, check details of construction
