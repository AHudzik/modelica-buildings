Before submitting a bug report, 
 * check https://corbu.lbl.gov/trac/bie/report/1 if the bug is already known, and
 * make sure that it is a bug of the model and not the modeling or simulation environment.
 
When submitting a bug report, please provide:
 * A *total model* that is as small as possible and still reproduces the error. The chances of quickly finding and fixing a bug are much higher if the bug is part of a small test problem. In Dymola, a *total model* can be saved by selecting ``File -> Save Total``.
 * A description of what is the expected result and what is the observed result.
 * An information about the operating system and the Modelica simulation environment that is used.

To report the bug, send email to https://groups.google.com/group/modelica-buildings. This is an open group and everyone can join it. No invitation is needed.
