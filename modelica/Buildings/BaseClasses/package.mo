<p>
Package <b>Buildings</b> is a free package
for modeling building HVAC systems. 
It provides partial models and model
components for modeling thermal building systems such as heating, ventilation and 
air-conditioning systems. 
Many models are based on models from the package
<a href=\"Modelica://Modelica_Fluid\">Modelica_Fluid</a> and use
the same ports to ensure compatibility with models from that library.
</p><p>
The web page that is dedicated to the development of this library is
<a href=\"https://gaia.lbl.gov/bir\">https://gaia.lbl.gov/bir</a>. 
We welcome contributions from different users to further advance this library, 
whether it is through collaborative model development, through model use and testing
or through requirements definition or by providing feedback regarding the model applicability
to solve specific problems.
